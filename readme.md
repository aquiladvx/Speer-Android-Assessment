# Speer Technologies Android assessment by DAVI AQUILA:

## Overview

This project was created in order to apply for an Android developer position at Speer Technologies.
The project requirements can be found in the [assessment github repository](https://github.com/speer-technologies/android-assessment).
The project was created using:
1. MVVM architecture
2. Hilt for dependency injection
3. Retrofit and OkHttp for web services

## Walkthrough

To run the project you will need a Github Access Token.
You can find how to generate a Github Access Token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
Once you have your token, you need to create and assign it to a variable called **GITHUB_TOKEN** inside your **local.properties** file located at the root of the project.

After that, you are able to run the project!
